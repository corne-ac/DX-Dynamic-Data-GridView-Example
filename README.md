<h1>Custom DevExpress DataGridView Two-Way Binding Implementation</h1>

<p>The purpose of this project is to find a solution to implement two way data bindign between the DataGridView from DevExpress and a custom data structure found inside the Models/form.cs File.</p>
<p>This enables the user to be able to edit t he data on the UI and it will reflect in the original object used to populate the grids. This also works the other way around, meaning that if the original data from the form object gets updated or changed, these changes will be reflected on the UI.</p>
